I am a postdoc in the lab of [Georg Gerber](http://gerber.bwh.harvard.edu) at Brigham and Women's Hospital.

I recently completed my PhD in the Department of Physics at Cornell
University, where I was advised by [Chris
Myers](http://cbsu.tc.cornell.edu/staff/myers/).

## Research

My thesis research focused on genome-scale models of metabolism in
C4 plants. I developed [software to construct and solve flux balance
analysis problems with nonlinear
constraints](http://github.com/ebogart/fluxtools), a new
reconstruction of the metabolic network of _Zea mays_, an algorithm
for inferring fluxes in metabolic models from transcriptomic data, and
a method to simulate evolution-like paths through high-dimensional
phenotypic fitness landscapes.
